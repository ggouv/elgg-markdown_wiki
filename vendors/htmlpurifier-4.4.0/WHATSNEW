HTML Purifier 4.4.0 is a minor security release addressing a security
vulnerability associated with some optional functionality.  It also
contains an accumulation of new features and bugfixes over half a year.
New configuration options include %HTML.TargetBlank,
%HTML.AllowedComments, %HTML.AllowedCommentsRegexp, %HTML.SafeIframe,
%URI.SafeIframeRegexp, %Core.EnableIDNA (requires PEAR Net_IDNA2 module and
doesn't work for PHP 5.0.5).  We also now support the 'scope' attribute on
tables.
